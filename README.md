## Intro
The following project demonstrates the setup of continuous integration for a PHP-based application.

## TOOLS USED
|TOOL            |DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Jenkins         |A Continuous Integration automation server. it was used to configure multibranch pipelines, build, test and deploy the application           |
|Ansible         |A configuration management tool. Applied in the automation of the server configurations.                                                     |
|Artifactory     |Binaries and artifacts management tool. Packaged artifacts were uploaded to its repository                                                   |
|Sonarqube       |A robust tool for carrying out the implementation of code reliability, maintainability and general software quality gates measures.          |
|PHP             |scripting language for the application                                                                                                       |
